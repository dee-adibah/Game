# Catch That Rat!

This is an inspiration from one of the arcade game called Whack-A-Mole.

## How To Play

Simply press the **Start** button and try to catch the rat when it appears by **_clicking_** on it.

**BUT!!** Be careful not to annoy the cranky cat. It will deduct your score if you click it.

The game ends when the timer is up.

###### _Note: you will gain a spot in the Score History if you manage to catch any of the rat and might be even on the top list if you manage to get highest score_

### **HAPPY PLAYING!** ^_^
